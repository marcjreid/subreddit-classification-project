21,1,"So I'm bored and on reddit when I should be sleeping... 

Looking for suggestions on what to watch this season I came across some of the re-watch episode reaction threads and I noticed that they're all stuff a slightly older millennial demographic would have watched.

Being this as it may, and with the new season needing about 2 more weeks to be properly judged I need something older and binge-worthy now. One can only re-watch all of dragon ball and DBZ so many times in their life.

To make this a little more fun - and to give the choices some context I want to know what the title implies:

To start: My first anime was RahXephon (one of the earlier studio BONES prices that has forever colored my outlook of Evangelion) I would love to see a HD remake. 

My favorite anime is a little harder of a pick but if it comes down to it I would pick Eureka Seven (The original not that AO crap). When it comes down to it robots, an environmentalist message and a love story between a boy and another life form gets me each time.

**Comment of the Day**

*It's hard to put into words what I'm feeling by the end, all I know is I'm feeling something. I think Shirase feels like this too. I think it's because she finally woke up from her dream, only when she finally saw those mails. All those mails she sent over the years hopelessly hoping that maybe her mom was still reading them, but now she has them all neatly listed on the screen, and the only one to see them is her.* - u/BosuW

*Today’s episode is my favorite one in the series and one of my all time favorites in anime. There's just so much I love about it. Eleven episodes of steady buildup all culminating in a huge emotional payoff had me sobbing the first time I watched it. Kana Hanazawa's performance was just phenomenal. The way she starts hyperventilating before she starts crying was so convincing and heartrending. And Atsuko Ishizuka's directing, especially during the laptop scene is the best example of ""show don't tell"" in a show that's overflowing with it. From the moment Shirase's friends found the laptop to the end of the episode not a single word was spoken (besides ""mom""), but we are able understand that Shirase meant the world to Takako and she finally accepted that her mom is never coming back. The part that hit me the hardest was seeing her friends in the hallway simultaneously giving her space but crying with her, showing us just how close all of them have gotten on this journey.* - u/surgemaster140

Especially, considering the fact that the series has ended.","Now that AoT's trailer is out, there's tons of spoilers, out in the open, pretty much everywhere. If there's any anime-onlies left, make it a point to not visit any comment section featuring Attack on Titan."
54,1,"**Why Deku not train with using his quirk (OFA) while weight lifting, doing push-ups etc?** 

So in my rewatch now im in season 3 and episode 3 and everyone makes training for train their quirks and while everybody get proper training for their quirks (with using their quirks while training and trying to improve quirks with good ways) Midoya wasn't even using his quirk while doing that ''Tiger's Bootcamp'' thing, and more oddly i just noticed we never saw Midoriya training while using his quirk even in season 4 (I didnt watched season 5, im doing rewatch for watching season 5) and its pretty odd.

Couldn't be more effective if he use his quirk while training and he can reach %100 power limit faster? He can lift lot more heavy objects, can run a lot more distance and with better speed, he can do more push-up with better ways like using weight pads on his arms and legs or wearing heavy suited designed for training (he can just ask U.A for those items btw), basicaly he can do more efficent training if he use his quirk for training seasons, so why he is not using his powers while running, doing push-ups or lifting weights etc? Or why All Might or any other teacher tell him this? Isn't that kind of unlogical?

For example we tell Deku lifting 20kg without OFA and strain his body and gain muscle/body power for reaching %100 OFA and power up.

And for example again we tell Deku can lift 100kg with OFA without strain his body, so he can try to weight 120 or someting to strain his muscles while using OFA and this will make him train his muscles with better effiency and able him to power up faster and reach his potencial faster.

Its basicaly same training process, only different thing is lifting more weight to reaching that point faster, running with weights and running more km (and faster) or doing push-ups with weights etc. But this training style would be 2-5X faster than normal process.","I have question, i wanna discuss someting about Boku no Hero Academia (Specifically about Deku)"
55,1,"Soo I never got into anime as I felt it was a bit cringe and something I wasn’t used to. The only “anime” I’ve watched was Pokémon and Avatar, but those are very Americanised, and I don’t think they fit in this category.

130,1,I mainly watch sub unless it doesn’t make sense. Dubbed really bothers me when they have to dumb things down just to fit flaps or if they change a characters voice fluctuation or inflection it can suddenly be a different character. Also curious if you’ve watched a sub and preferred the dubbed instead what show was it?,Subbed or dubbed ?
131,1,In my opinion people who watch anime will be less impressed with the squid game because the concept had alot of similarities with anime. In anime you see more of these ‘ wild ‘ concepts which leads to being able to understand and grasp the concept quicker. people who havent seen anime are more impressed. And clearly they enjoy it. i wonder if they would enjoy watching shows like tokyo ghoul or kaiji madhouse just as much as squid game,The new popular show ‘Squid game’ is a great example why more people should watch anime

232,1,In my opinion people who watch anime will be less impressed with the squid game because the concept had alot of similarities with anime. In anime you see more of these ‘ wild ‘ concepts which leads to being able to understand and grasp the concept quicker. people who havent seen anime are more impressed. And clearly they enjoy it. i wonder if they would enjoy watching shows like tokyo ghoul or kaiji madhouse just as much as squid game,The new popular show ‘Squid game’ is a great example why more people should watch anime

318,1,"So I'm bored and on reddit when I should be sleeping... 

Looking for suggestions on what to watch this season I came across some of the re-watch episode reaction threads and I noticed that they're all stuff a slightly older millennial demographic would have watched.

Being this as it may, and with the new season needing about 2 more weeks to be properly judged I need something older and binge-worthy now. One can only re-watch all of dragon ball and DBZ so many times in their life.

To make this a little more fun - and to give the choices some context I want to know what the title implies:

To start: My first anime was RahXephon (one of the earlier studio BONES prices that has forever colored my outlook of Evangelion) I would love to see a HD remake. 

My favorite anime is a little harder of a pick but if it comes down to it I would pick Eureka Seven (The original not that AO crap). When it comes down to it robots, an environmentalist message and a love story between a boy and another life form gets me each time.

Help me pick something bingeworthy until the new season solidifies! I'm curious to hear about others favorites and firsts!",What was your first and what you all time favorite?

363,1,"So I'm bored and on reddit when I should be sleeping... 

Looking for suggestions on what to watch this season I came across some of the re-watch episode reaction threads and I noticed that they're all stuff a slightly older millennial demographic would have watched.

Being this as it may, and with the new season needing about 2 more weeks to be properly judged I need something older and binge-worthy now. One can only re-watch all of dragon ball and DBZ so many times in their life.

To make this a little more fun - and to give the choices some context I want to know what the title implies:

To start: My first anime was RahXephon (one of the earlier studio BONES prices that has forever colored my outlook of Evangelion) I would love to see a HD remake. 

My favorite anime is a little harder of a pick but if it comes down to it I would pick Eureka Seven (The original not that AO crap). When it comes down to it robots, an environmentalist message and a love story between a boy and another life form gets me each time.

413,0,So this manga is a fantasy kind where the main character is a buff female knight with scars all over her ( it’s not How to Treat a Lady Knight Right). She is a bit small in hight and she has a helmet. In the first few chapters she makes a bet with someone where if she won he would have to tell her his problem he is dealing with. The challenge was to see who cums first. She wins but she breaks the bed in the process (yes this is a manga). Near the end of the chapter she talks to a member of a church who seems to be a old friend.,Can’t remember manga title.

427,0,"Hello! I am looking for two types of manga recommendations, please. 

**1) Non-(Or Limited)-Fanservice Shounen**

While I know there are definitely some great shounen titles out there, the one thing that has constantly put me off of this genre is the constant fanservice. 

Fanservice includes, but is not limited to, random underwear or nude shots that make no sense to the plot, sexual assault scenes that are promoted as normal or even sexy, blatant sexualization of characters (usually minors), and characters with really revealing outfits. 

I've pretty much given up with this genre because of this. I would really like some good recommendations for shounen manga with no fanservice, or very limited fanservice, if possible. I have already read *FullMetal Alchemist* (almost no fanservice there) and watched *Demon Slayer* (almost none apart from a certain character's costume), so I know there must be some more out there. 

Thank you in advance!

**2) Spooky Manga**

I do love the horror genre! However, I am looking for some spooky or Halloween-related manga to get in the mood for this October. I am already considering *Soul Eater*, but would like some more recommendations if possible!

Spooky can be about witches, vampires, werewolves, supernatural creatures, or revolve around Halloween as a theme, for reference!

Thank you all again for your consideration!

**TL;DR: Would love to get recommended some good shounen manga with no, or limited, fanservice, and/or some spooky manga to get in the mood for Halloween this year! These two factors don't have to be present in one manga, so one or the other would be fine.**",Manga Recommendations - Non-Fanservice Shounen and/or Spooky Manga

One chapter was about an unattractive obese guy who fell in love with a girl who was nice to him. There was also a school ""prince"" who was good at basketball and thats all he wanted to do but his dad wanted him to marry and run the company. 
They switched brains, the prince running off the weight on the obese guy and going back to basketball, and the obese guy going after the girl who was kind to him before.

The now new ""basketball player"" ends up being a target for male rapists because of his pretty but masculine look.

I just figured I would give people a heads up that the series is now completed, and the last chapter goes free in the next day or two at https://www.lezhinus.com/en/comic/gilgamesh_en


This is one of those series that was getting a fan scanlation back in the day, but then an official translation started so the fan one stopped, but the official one was doing 1 chapter/week and took a few years to catch up.  Turns out it ended like ~20 chapters after the last fan translated one just to make it extra annoying.


I like the series so I would check on the official translation every once in a while and just happened to check it a week or so ago and figured others might want the heads up.  Now if only I could find someone doing the Trace 2.0, which stopped when an official source picked it up the series, but the official source ended up only doing like 4 chapters with random release schedule (can't remember if this happened during 2.0 or the armorline part)",Epic of Gilgamesh

My youtube channel (same name) was a review channel where I reviewd the newest chapters of My Hero Academia, along with a few other anime and manga's. I got an email yesterday saying that Shueisha had striked every single one of my MHA videos, and thus my channel was disabled.

I'm really not sure where I stand on this at all. I know I'm probably at fault for using some chapter pages in my videos, but as far as I knew it fell under fair use since it was only 4 or 5 pages out of a chapter, and all my reviews weren't being monetised so I wasn't earning anything from them.

It just absolutely destroyed me, knowing that all the effort I put into a channel got thrown in the trash without any warning. I didn't even get any emails to say anything had been copyright stiked until the one where I was told the channel was disabled. I can't access anything, and I'm honestly at sucha loss of what to do. I want to do a counter-claim, but I also read that I can be held legally accountable if my claim isn't right?

562,0,"I remember when I was much younger I loved this manga, but I can't recall the name. It was about a guy who would surgically swap the brains of two people who each had what the other person wanted. It usually ended dark with the theme of being grateful for who you are because you don't fully understand another person's life. 
One chapter was about an unattractive obese guy who fell in love with a girl who was nice to him. There was also a school ""prince"" who was good at basketball and thats all he wanted to do but his dad wanted him to marry and run the company. 
They switched brains, the prince running off the weight on the obese guy and going back to basketball, and the obese guy going after the girl who was kind to him before. 
But it doesn't end there. The now ""prince"" ends up becoming a womanizer and substance abuser. The girl who had been nice to him that he now betrayed, ends up stabbing him many times until he dies. The now new ""basketball player"" ends up being a target for male rapists because of his pretty but masculine look. 
The basketball player runs back to the ""surgeon"" who swapped the brains, begging him to swap them back. But he informs him theres nothing he can do, as the other guy is now dead. 

Really dark, but the art and story boarding seemed so good to me at the time. If anyone at all knows the title, please let me know!",Whats this manga?

I'm looking for a very specific manga I read a few years ago.

622,0,"I remember when I was much younger I loved this manga, but I can't recall the name. It was about a guy who would surgically swap the brains of two people who each had what the other person wanted. It usually ended dark with the theme of being grateful for who you are because you don't fully understand another person's life. 
One chapter was about an unattractive obese guy who fell in love with a girl who was nice to him. There was also a school ""prince"" who was good at basketball and thats all he wanted to do but his dad wanted him to marry and run the company. 
They switched brains, the prince running off the weight on the obese guy and going back to basketball, and the obese guy going after the girl who was kind to him before. 
But it doesn't end there. The now ""prince"" ends up becoming a womanizer and substance abuser. The girl who had been nice to him that he now betrayed, ends up stabbing him many times until he dies. The now new ""basketball player"" ends up being a target for male rapists because of his pretty but masculine look. 
The basketball player runs back to the ""surgeon"" who swapped the brains, begging him to swap them back. But he informs him theres nothing he can do, as the other guy is now dead. 

Really dark, but the art and story boarding seemed so good to me at the time. If anyone at all knows the title, please let me know!",Whats this manga?

My friend wanted the series cage of eden. Some of the volumes are out of print everywhere. The last volume was released in 2017 (in english). That doesn't seem that long ago for it to already be out of print, but I don't know enough about how long manga supplies last and when and if they re-print.

So my question is, how do I know if they will re-print a series like cage of eden? (A not universally known series). Any chance it receives an ""omnibus"" or something?
